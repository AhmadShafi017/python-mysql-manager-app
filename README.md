🚀 Advanced Modular User Management System (v2.0)A high-performance, Modular Backend Ecosystem built with Python and MySQL. This version introduces a sophisticated Stack-Based Navigation Controller, allowing for complex nested menus and a professional CLI (Command Line Interface) experience.🛠️ Advanced Core Features🕹️ Stack-Based Navigation: Implements a custom "Navigation Stack" (stack.py) to manage application state, enabling seamless "Back" and "Home" transitions across 30+ logic paths.🛡️ Multi-Layer Validation: Centralized RegEx engines for data integrity:Name: Strict alphabetic filtering.Email: Pattern matching for global standards.Age: Range-bound numerical verification.🔍 Granular Search Engine: Specialized modules for high-speed data retrieval (search_by_id.py, search_by_name.py, etc.).📈 Real-Time Analytics: Dedicated computational modules to extract meaningful insights like Average User Demographics and Total Record Metrics.⚠️ Disaster Recovery & Safety: Multi-step confirmation prompts for high-risk operations (Table Drop/Database Deletion).🔐 Environment Security: Fully integrated with python-dotenv to keep sensitive database credentials out of version control.📁 Modular Project ArchitectureThe system is broken down into specialized "Task Clusters" for maximum maintainability:⚙️ Core Enginemain.py - The application entry point and central router.stack.py - The navigation state controller.pages.py - The global registry of application states.database.py - Secure connection management and schema initialization.⚡ Action ModulesFeatureSpecialized FilesUser Ingestionadd.py, add_single_user.py, add_multiple_user.pyData Retrievalsearch.py, search_by_id.py, search_by_name.py, ...Modificationupdate.py, update_name.py, update_age.py, update_email.pyData Cleanupdelete.py, delete_single_user.py, delete_table.py, ...Insightsanalytics.py, average.py, total.py🚀 Installation & Setup1️⃣ PrerequisitesPython 3.10+MySQL Serverpip (Python package manager)2️⃣ Clone & ConfigureBash# Clone the repository
